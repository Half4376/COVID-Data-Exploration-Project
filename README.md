## Introduction

In this project, I analyzed COVID-19 data to uncover trends and insights regarding the pandemic's spread and the impact of vaccinations. The analysis was performed using SQL with data stored in PostgreSQL.

## Objectives

- Analyze COVID-19 deaths and vaccination data.
- Derive insights about infection rates, death rates, and vaccination impact.
- Showcase SQL skills and data analysis capabilities.

## Dataset

Dataset is sourced from [Our World in Data: COVID-19 Deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) and includes data on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations.

## Data Preparation

1. **Download and Clean Data:**
  - Download the CSV file.
  - Rearrange and clean the data as necessary.
2. **Remove Unnecessary Columns:**
  - Delete columns not required for this analysis.
3. **Export Cleaned Data:**
  - Save the cleaned data into two separate CSV files: 'CovidDeaths' and 'CovidVaccinations'.

## Database Setup

Using PostgreSQL 'covidSQLDataExploration', create tables to store the cleaned data.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data Cleaning and Preparation
- SQL Query Writing
- Data Aggregation and Calculation
- Use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and Temporary Tables
- Data Analysis and Visualization

## Tools and Technologies
- PostgresSQL
- pgAdmin 4
- SQL

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates my ability to perform in-depth data analysis using SQL. I effectively cleaned and prepared data, created and managed database schemas, and derived insightful conclusions from the data.
